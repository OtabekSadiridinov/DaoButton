## Welcome to my first package for VueJS:  DaoButton

This is the firs package I made for using with VueJS. In short, I was using this as global component in my VueJS applications. Now, I wanted to share this if anyone likes this. This is absolutely free(like other NPM packages) and easy to use. Just read more below.
